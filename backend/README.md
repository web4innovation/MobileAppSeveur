This folder will contain all the code to implement a RESTful web server. It will also contain all the necessary instructions to setup and run the web server on a new machine.

The web server is developed using python3.4 and the flask library. 
This work was inspired by http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/designing-a-restful-api-with-python-and-flask
